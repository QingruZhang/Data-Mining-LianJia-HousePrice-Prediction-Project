# Data Mining Project:Lianjia House Price Prediction
This repository is established to explore data on [LianJia](https://sh.lianjia.com/), which is a second-hand housing trading platform and covers house info like area size, facing direction, elevator ratio and so on.
Overall, the work in this repo could be summarized in following aspects: 

- Collect the house information using python crawler. 
- Preprocess the data (clean, discretize, match, normalize, etc).
- Conduct feature engineering to analyse the data.
- Apply various classic machine learning algorithms to predict house price.
- Construct BiLSTM model to parse raw describtive text of house and combine it to MLP.
